## Information technology <span id="1.1">

What is information technology?

>Information Technology(IT)
>The use of digital technology,like computers and the Internet,to store and process data into useful information

# Algorithm <span id="2">

A series of steps that solve specific problems.

# Cryptography <span id="3">

The art of writing and solving codes.

# GNU <span id="4">

## Open source <span id="4.1">

Anyone could modify and share it.

Operation System.

# software <span id="5">

compiler was invented by Admiral Grace.
Hopper compilers made it possible to translate human language via a program language into machine code in case you didn't totally catch that we'll talk more about compilers later.
now learning programming languages is accessible for almost anyone anywhere.
that scares you don't worry we'll help you every step of the way but for now let's get back to the evolution of computers.

who knows what the future holds


## computer language <span id="5.1">

> 0 + 1 = ?

simple math problem 0 plus 1 equals what?

Binary system The communication that a computer uses, also known as a base-2 numeral system.
We group binary into 8 numbers or bits. 
Technically,a bit is a binary digit.

A group of 8 bits is referred to as a byte.

Each byte can store one character, and we can have 256 possible values thanks to the base-2 system(2^8).

01101000-h
01100101-e
01101100-I
01101111-o

computer talk this byte can mean something like the letter C and this is how a computer language is born

What does the following translate to?

01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111

something we'd be able to recognize what does the following translate.

make sure you understand the concept before moving on.

## Character encoding <span id="5.2">

you can think of character encoding as a dictionary it's a way for your computer's to look up which human character should be represented by a given binary value.

The first character in the ASCll to binary table--a lowercase a
-maps to 01100001
in binary.

RGB

that's used in a lot of computers RGB or red green and blue model. 

very cool 

with just eight combinations of zeros and ones were able to represent everything that you see on your computer from a simple letter A to the very video that you're watching right now.


## Logic gates <span id="5.3">

we'll discuss how we actually generate the zeros and ones.

Allow our transistors to do more complex tasks,like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions.

Digital Logic
How to Count in Binary?

that you understand how computers count in binary we've shown you simple look-up tables that you can use like the ASCll to binary table.

you'll need to know how binary works.

Decimal form : Base-10 system 0123456789

The Modern Computer
Intro to Computer Hardware

desktop

components

Ports
Connection points that we can connect
devices to that extend the functionality of
our computer

CPU
(Central Processing Unit)
The brain of our computer,it does all the calculations and data processing

RAM
(Random Access Memory)
Our computer's short-term memory

Hard drive Holds all of our data,which includes all of our music,pictures,applications

Motherboard
The body or circulatory system of the
computer that connects all the pieces
together

>computer can only communicate in binary using ones and zeros our computers
>
>our computers speak in machine language but we of course speak in human languages like English Spanish Mandarin Hindi you get the idea if we want to communicate with our machines we have to have some sort of translation dictionary just like if I wanted to say something in Spanish.

> well our computers have a built-in translation book.

2.Put peanut butter on one slice.
3.Put jelly on another slice.
4.Combine the two slices of bread.

There are 3 different cache levels in a CPU: L1,L2, andL3.

L1is the smallest and fastest cache.

![ram](https://AppleLin8.github.io/assets/img/blog/it/ram_20201122183922.png)

There are lots of types of RAM, and the one that's commonly found in computers is DRAM, or dynamic random-access memory.

There are also different types of memorysticks that DRAM chips can be put on. The more modern DIMM sticks, which usuallystands for Dual Inline Memory Module, have different sizes of pins on them.

SDRAM

In today's system, we use another type of RAM, called double data rate SDRAM or DDR SDRAM for short.

to understand electricy let's use the example of water pipes.

the higher the pressure the more water there will be when it comes electricity we refer to the pressure as Voltage.
